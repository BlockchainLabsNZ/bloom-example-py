Tested with Python 3.7.

1. Install requirements:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  Note: due to an issue with the way the PyPI package is built, pybloom must be
  installed from a GitHub repo.  See <https://github.com/jaybaird/python-bloomfilter/issues/39>
  for more info.

2. Run example:
  ```
  python bloom_example.py
  ```
